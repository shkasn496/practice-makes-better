TC: O( (m*n)â‹…3^L ) where (m*n) is the number of cells in the board and L is the 
length of the word to be matched. For the backtracking function, initially 
we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the 
choices are reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from). 
As a result, the execution trace after the first step could be visualized 
as a 3-ary tree, each of the branches represent a potential exploration in 
the corresponding direction. 
Therefore, in the worst case, the total number of invocation would be the 
number of nodes in a full 3-nary tree, which is about 3^L.

We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be N times 
invocation for the backtracking function in the worst case.
