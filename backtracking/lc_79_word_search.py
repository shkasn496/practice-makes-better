Solution : Backtracking

TC: O(Nâ‹…3^L ) where N is the number of cells in the board and L is the length of the word to be matched
For the backtracking function, initially we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the 
choices are reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from). As a result, the execution 
trace after the first step could be visualized as a 3-ary tree, each of the branches represent a 
potential exploration in the corresponding direction. 
Therefore, in the worst case, the total number of invocation would be the number of nodes in a 
full 3-nary tree, which is about 3^L.

We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be N times invocation for 
the backtracking function in the worst case.
